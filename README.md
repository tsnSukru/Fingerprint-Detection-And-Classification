Fingerprint Detection and Classification

## Project Description

This project is my university senior project. Project classifies fingerprints using Artificial Neural Network.
It finds minutiae in fingerprints. It check matching of the different fingerprints.

## Method

A CNN type ANN has been used to classify fingerprints. To find minutiae, Matlab codes developed in the study ‘Fingerprint Image Enhancement and Minutiae Extraction [2003]’ by Peter Kovesi and Raymond Thai have been used. These Matlab codes have been translated into Python. I would like to thank Peter Kovesi and Raymond Thai for this study.

## Base Requirements

1. Python 3.8
2. PyQt5 5.15
3. Tensorflow 2.13

## How to Use

After installation Run Main.py file.
If you want to train your own model, you can use the codes in the utility folder.
